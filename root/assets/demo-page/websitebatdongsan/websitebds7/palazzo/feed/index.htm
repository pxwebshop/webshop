<p>Home buying hurdles exist — but research, creativity and flexibility will help you clear them.</p>



<p>Home buyers today face tough challenges — housing prices have soared, a dollar doesn’t go as far as it once did and rent is more expensive than the past.</p>



<p>How are people today making such a large purchase despite these hurdles? With more flexibility and a bit of financing creativity, today’s buyers are finding ways to achieve homeownership.<br></p>



<h2>Know your options (and credit score)</h2>



<p>The first step to knowing if you can afford a home is figuring out what financing options are available to you, including what mortgages you’re eligible for and how much you need (and can afford) to put down upfront.</p>



<p>Learning the minimum FICO score required by lenders and understanding your own credit score are important starting points.</p>



<p>Many home shoppers aren’t sure how much they have to put down on a home, what the lender-required minimum down payment will be (it’s not always 20%), or what programs are available to help with down payments, like FHA loans.</p>



<p>Before buyers even start thinking about saving for a home, they should&nbsp;know what their financial resources are&nbsp;and if they’re eligible to buy.</p>



<h2>Make enough money to save</h2>



<p>With fewer resources to pull from than their older, wealthier counterparts, renters wanting to buy face tough financial headwinds.</p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trends Report 2019, renter households typically earn a median income of $37,500 annually, which is nearly $40,000 less than the median household income netted by households who recently bought a home (of whom the median household income is $75,000 annually).</p>



<p>While there are ways to enter into homeownership without making $75,000 in household income, it’s hard to afford to buy if you make significantly less. “If you’re making $37,500 per year, it’s probably not feasible for you to buy in almost any market,” says Zillow Chief Economist&nbsp;Dr. Svenja Gudell.</p>



<p>While households purchasing homes are more likely to have two incomes than renter households (and thus a higher median household income combined), even two-income households struggle to afford to buy in competitive markets.</p>



<h2>Save enough cash (but not as much as you think)</h2>



<p>One of the most daunting parts of home buying? The down payment. In fact, two-thirds of renters cite saving for a down payment as the biggest hurdle to buying a home, according to the&nbsp;Zillow Housing Aspirations Report.</p>



<p>For people buying the national median home valued at $229,000, with the traditional 20% down payment, that’s $45,800 upfront — just to move in.</p>



<p>“The down payment remains a hurdle for a lot of people,” says Gudell. “But they should know they don’t have to put 20% down.”</p>



<p>Although putting down less than 20% means additional considerations, such as the cost for private mortgage insurance (PMI), some find it worth the hassle. In fact, according to the&nbsp;Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trends Report 2019, only one-fifth of recent buyers (20%) put 20% down, and just over half of buyers (56%) put&nbsp;<em>less</em>&nbsp;than the traditional 20% down.</p>



<p>Buyers are also getting creative about piecing together a down payment from multiple sources. According to the report findings, 34% of buyers who get a mortgage also get help in the form of gifts or loans from friends and family to come up with a down payment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Know your deal breakers, but be flexible</h2>



<p>To get into a home — even if it’s not the home of their dreams — some of today’s buyers are considering homes and locations outside of their initial wish list and getting increasingly flexible when it comes to neighborhood, house condition and even home type.</p>



<p>“I do think people get discouraged when they look in their target neighborhood and they see homes around $170,000 when they’re looking for a $110,000 home,” Gudell says.</p>



<p>Affordably priced homes do, in fact, exist. But in popular areas, where people most often want to live, it’s going to be harder to find that cheaper home, Gudell says.</p>



<p>“If you’re willing to take a longer commute and make a couple trade-offs, you might be able to find a home that is farther out that might be cheaper,” Gudell explains. “You have to leave the paved path before you can find cheaper choices.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Everyone who applies for housing has the right to be treated the same. The Fair Housing Act was created with the goal of advising landlords, lenders, buyers, and renters of the housing practices that could be considered discriminatory.</p>



<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2">What Is the Fair Housing Act?</h3>



<p>The Fair Housing Act is a law that was created to put an end to discriminatory practices involving any activities related to housing. The Act was created with the belief that every person has the right to rent a home, purchase a home,&nbsp;or get a mortgage on a home without being afraid of discrimination due to their membership in a certain class of people.</p>



<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-5">When Was the Fair Housing Law Created?</h3>



<p>Attempts at fair housing in America have been around since the mid-1800s, but it was not until the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s that any real change took place. The Rumford Fair Housing Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were two of the first attempts to address discrimination. The real groundbreaking legislation, however, was the Fair Housing Act of 1968 which was established one week after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.</p>



<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-8">What Classes Are Protected Under the Fair Housing Act?</h3>



<p>The seven&nbsp;classes protected under the Federal Fair Housing Act are:</p>



<ol><li>Color</li><li>Disability</li><li>Familial Status&nbsp;(i.e., having children under 18 in a household, including pregnant women)&nbsp;</li><li>National Origin</li><li>Race</li><li>Religion</li><li>Sex</li></ol>



<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-13">What Is the Three-Part Goal of the Fair Housing Act?</h3>



<p>The Fair Housing Act has a three-part goal:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>1. Home Renting and Selling</em></p>



<p>To end discrimination against the protected classes in any of the following ways:</p>



<ul><li>Refusing to rent housing, sell housing, or negotiate for housing</li><li>Making housing unavailable or lying about the availability of housing</li><li>Denying housing</li><li>Establishing different terms or conditions in home selling or renting</li><li>Providing different housing accommodations or amenities</li><li>Blockbusting</li><li>Denying participation in housing-related services such as a&nbsp;multiple listing service</li></ul>



<p><em>2. Mortgage Lending</em></p>



<p>To end discrimination against the protected classes in any of the following ways:</p>



<ul><li>Refusing to make or purchase a mortgage loan</li><li>Setting different terms or conditions on the loan, such as interest rates or fees</li><li>Setting different requirements for purchasing a loan</li><li>Refusing to make information about the loan available</li><li>Discriminatory practices in property appraising</li></ul>



<p><em>3. Other Illegal Activities</em></p>



<p>To end discrimination against the protected classes in either of these ways:</p>



<ul><li>Make discriminatory statements or&nbsp;advertise your property&nbsp;indicating a preference for a person with a certain background or excluding a protected class. This applies to those who are otherwise exempt from the Fair Housing Act, such as owner-occupied four-unit homes.</li><li>Threaten or interfere with anyone’s fair housing rights.</li></ul>



<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-34">Does Everyone Have to Follow the Fair Housing Act?</h3>



<p>In certain cases, the following groups may be exempt from following the Act:</p>



<ul><li>Single-family homes that are rented or sold without using a broker;</li><li>Owner-occupied&nbsp;homes with no more than four units; and</li><li>Members-only private clubs or organizations.</li></ul>



<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-39">Who Enforces the Fair Housing Act?</h3>



<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for enforcing the Fair Housing Act.</p>



<p>HUD enforces the Act in two ways:</p>



<ol><li><em>Fair Housing Testers:&nbsp;</em>HUD hires people to pose as renters or home buyers to see if discriminatory practices are being used. As a landlord, you need to be careful what you say in person, on the phone, and in rental ads.</li><li><em>Investigate Discrimination Claims:</em>&nbsp;Individuals who feel their fair housing rights have been violated under the Fair Housing Act can file a discrimination claim with HUD. HUD will investigate the claim, determine if there is any merit to it, and decide if further legal action is necessary.</li></ol>



<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-46">Tips for Avoiding Accusations of Discrimination</h3>



<p>To ensure you remain compliant with the Fair Housing Act, assume everyone works for HUD or is trying to accuse you of discrimination. Be extremely careful with what you say in person, on the phone, and in your rental ads.</p>



<p>You must adhere to the terms of the Fair Housing Act, but you can rule out tenants based on other criteria. You can legally deny&nbsp;a tenant housing based on poor credit, inability to pay rent, or other information found when you&nbsp;run a credit check&nbsp;on them.</p>



<p>Be consistent in&nbsp;screening tenants, and have the same&nbsp;qualifying standards&nbsp;for every tenant. Go through the exact same practices for each&nbsp;prospective tenant&nbsp;who applies to rent your property. Require the same information, documents, referrals, and fees.</p>



<p>Treat everyone with respect and dignity.</p>



<p>Many states have additional protected classes, such as sexual orientation, age, and student status. Check your local and state fair housing laws to make sure you are following them in addition to the federal law.</p>

<p>The best way to create a cozy bedroom you’ll love snuggling up to? Find a look that reflects your personality.</p>



<p>Aah… the bedroom of your dreams. Will it include fuzzy pillows or homespun quilts? Perhaps it’s covered wall to wall in plush rugs. Or maybe it’s a clutter-free, serene space.</p>



<p>Rest assured, this quiz will help you discover your style.</p>



<p>Imagine dreaming in your dream bedroom. At Freshome, we spend a lot of time thinking about exactly that. Because we’re obsessed with design and decor, each person on our team has spent time, energy and – yes – even money creating the ultimate bedroom for each of our personal tastes. And while all of our rooms look pretty different, there are some overarching similarities. In fact, there are some elements we all agree&nbsp;that a dream bedroom needs.</p>



<p>What makes the ideal place for sleeping, lounging and (we can be honest) binging our latest Netflix addiction? Like we said, the little details will look a little different depending on personal preferences, but the key elements are the same. Here are the “big four” to consider when creating your dream bedroom.</p>



<h2>The bed: cushy and cozy</h2>



<p>It’s no surprise that none of us are coveting the twin beds of our youths. Instead, the Freshome team is strongly in favor of a king bed (or California king, if you want to go really crazy) where you can spread out and get some quality sleep. And if you’re going to get a big, cushy bed, you might as well frame it well. We’re fans of a grandiose&nbsp;four-poster bed&nbsp;if you’re looking to make a big statement.</p>



<p>Or, if you want to give your room an extra cozy feel, try this&nbsp;upholstered headboard&nbsp;from Pottery Barn or&nbsp;upholstered bed frame&nbsp;from Joss &amp; Main. Adding extra padding around your mattress makes your&nbsp;whole bed feel like a cloud for an extra comfortable place to cozy up.</p>



<h2>The bedding: luxe and layered</h2>



<p>When it comes to bedding, it’s all about layering. Finding a duvet you love is a great start, but it’s just the beginning. From there, layer on lots of pillows, including decorative throw pillows in your favorite accent colors, and throws.</p>



<p>Because you’ll want the flexibility to change out your accent pillows and throws with your changing tastes and the seasons, we vote for a neutral duvet cover as your bedding’s base. If you need a simple duvet,&nbsp;this one&nbsp;from Target is ideal to get you started. Think of it as your canvas. You’re the artist – you can use this simple base to create your dream bed! All you need is a little creativity. To spark your greatest ideas, we’ve rounded up some&nbsp;cold-weather bedding&nbsp;and&nbsp;extra luxurious bedding&nbsp;ideas for you.</p>



<h2>The closet: big and beautiful</h2>



<p>Of course, every single one of us would love to have a&nbsp;walk-in closet. If you’ve got the space, it’s well worth creating an area you can step into when picking out your outfit, or just admiring your wardrobe. A walk-in is easier to keep organized and adds resale value to your home.</p>



<p>But what about those of us who live in a more compact footprint? Even if you don’t have space for a walk-in à la Carrie Bradshaw, you still deserve a closet that looks nice and is easy to use. Closet organizers, like&nbsp;these gorgeous linen ones&nbsp;from The Container Store, can help you transform your closet from&nbsp;<em>ho-hum&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>oh dang!</em>&nbsp;Switching to thin, velvet-lined hangers can similarly streamline and beautify your wardrobe.</p>

<p><br>Rule #1 of the best week off at home: Plan ahead.</p>



<p>You don’t need to stay in a hotel and play tourist to have a proper staycation. Look no further than your own home for a staycaytion dreams are made of.</p>



<p>Make no mistake, an at-home staycation doesn’t&nbsp;just mean a lazy weekend on the couch. Turn your humble abode into a resort made for relaxation with a few days of planning and prep work.</p>



<p>Here’s your guide to creating&nbsp;the ultimate staycation.</p>



<h2>Tackle chores in advance</h2>



<p>Make a list of chores you want to tackle a few days before your staycation begins. At the very least, cover the basics like washing linens, dusting and vacuuming.</p>



<p>For an added level of sparkle, schedule time to clean your windows. That way when you’re staring out to your backyard garden or pool (aka your staycaytion resort spa), your windows will be as spick-and-span as those at a five-star bed and breakfast.</p>



<p>Better yet, for a totally chore-free staycaytion, consider setting aside extra cash for a housecleaning service to do the work for you beforehand.</p>



<h2>Maximize your comfort</h2>



<p>Maybe your home is already perfectly comfy and cozy. But for maximum staycation relaxation, why not add a few extra elements to make your home feel like a luxury resort?</p>



<ul><li><strong>Adjust your lighting.&nbsp;</strong>Look for soft ambient lighting options to create a calming environment. New lamps for bedroom and living areas and candles for the master bath can completely change the mood of a space.</li><li><strong>Add new rugs.&nbsp;</strong>Soft, plush area rugs boost the comfort level of&nbsp;a room and make a cozy reading spot if you add a few floor pillows.</li><li><strong>Buy new bedding.&nbsp;</strong>Not only will it feel like you’re truly on a vacation somewhere else, but new sheets are an added perk after your leisure time comes to a close.</li></ul>



<h2>Create designated spaces</h2>



<p>Think about what kind of environment will help you reach peak relaxation. You can do a quick makeover of your bathroom to create a calming home spa or carve out a quiet corner for a meditation or reading nook.</p>



<p>If a spa setting is more your style, look at bath pillows, aromatherapy candles and bath oils. Or if you simply crave a reading corner, pick up some new reads that have been sitting on your wish list for too long.</p>



<p>If you have kids, create a designated craft or board-game corner, or come up with a few activities they can enjoy while you relax.</p>



<p>Look outside for added comfort ideas too. Whether it’s a hammock, a porch swing or patio furniture, look for ways to blend your staycaytion lounging with the great outdoors.</p>



<p>On that note, consider setting up your camping gear in the backyard for part of your staycaytion, or try out a&nbsp;DIY fire pit&nbsp;for late-night chats and s’mores.</p>



<h2>Manage meals ahead of time</h2>



<p>Don’t waste precious relaxation time planning menus. Pick your favorite family recipes, plan which meals you’ll have delivered and knock out grocery shopping before your staycaytion begins.</p>



<p>If you enjoy cooking, consider using some of your staycation time to make more intricate meals than you typically have time for — or bring in a local chef for a cooking lesson.</p>



<h2>Plan ahead to make it count</h2>



<p>With a few preparatory tasks on your to-do list, you can turn your house into a staycaytion sanctuary. Map out what you want your staycation to be like, and delegate tasks. Soon you’ll be ready for a few days of ultimate relaxation — without ever leaving your home.<br></p>

<p>Breathe new life into a dated split-level with these tips — you have more options than you might think!</p>



<p>What’s not to love about a split-level home? The interior spaces flow. And while the change in floor level creates a partial separation of spaces, they are visually connected from one level to the next. Split-levels are cool — on the inside.</p>



<p>The outside is often another story. Split-level exteriors tend to be a bit bland. If you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. And that’s probably because so many of them were built during the 1970s. T1-11 siding (plywood sheets with vertical grooves spaced 8 inches apart) is common on the upper levels, and the upper floors tend to be cantilevered out over the structural walls below.</p>



<p>Split-level homes can feel dated. But a few simple modifications can transform them, making &nbsp;them one of the best fixer-upper options.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at a few of the primary changes you might make to create a modern masterpiece from the average split-level home.</p>



<h2>Split-level remodel: siding</h2>



<p>Modern home styles are generally made up of two surface types. The predominant surface is generally smooth and clean. Stucco is the most common material used to achieve this look, and thankfully, it’s not very difficult to stucco over many existing exterior siding products, such as T1-11. Any split-level modernization project should look very closely at ways to make those exterior walls smooth.</p>



<p>The second exterior wall surface, which can make a huge impact and is easily retrofitted, is a natural stone of some sort. Think of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater, and take note of the contrast between perfectly smooth wall surfaces and the texture of natural stone used intermittently throughout the design. A split-level home already has the structural breaks that make this kind of mix look perfect.</p>



<h2>Split-level remodel: windows</h2>



<p>Single-hung windows, which feature bottom panes that slide up to open the windows, are common in split-level homes from the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s. And many of them are Colonial style, meaning that they feature grids that divide the window into 12 or more small “lites,” rather than larger panes of glass.</p>



<p>Replacing old windows with a more modern style can greatly modernize your home’s look. Consider casement windows, which feature cranks and swing out to open up. Horizontal sliders can also provide a more modern look. Fixed glass is another very modern type of window, but it won’t work for bedrooms that require an emergency escape and ventilation.</p>



<h2>Split-level remodel: roof color and material</h2>



<p>The roof is an oft-overlooked aspect of a home’s exterior, which is surprising given the size of both the visible surface area of the roof and the investment required to have a new one installed. A roof is far more than a utilitarian way to keep precipitation out of the house — it’s an important design element that can make or break an exterior remodel.</p>



<p>Some roof colors simply won’t work with a contemporary design — an old shingle roof usually looks anything but clean and smooth. Dark colors tend to work well with shingle roofs, and the potential to switch to a standing seam metal roof should also be considered.</p>



<p>If you want to go full-on modern, consider hiding the roof completely. This may involve a major structural overhaul, but it’s worth considering. Always consider even the most extreme ideas if you’re planning to be in the home for a long time.</p>



<h2>Split-level remodel: exterior lighting</h2>



<p>A very simple way of updating the look of a traditional split-level is to add some bling to the design. Exterior accessories such as light fixtures and house numbers can make a huge difference. Modern home designs tend to focus on lighting details. A split-level home has a few great places to start.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The pathway to the front door:&nbsp;</strong>Often sloped to reach the middle level, this pathway could be an ideal place for some interesting lighting.</li><li><strong>The overhang of the cantilevered second levels:</strong>&nbsp;These existing spaces are great for recessed lighting that illuminates the wall beneath, which you might want to cover in natural stone.</li><li><strong>Either side of the front entry:</strong>&nbsp;If the home design includes a forward-facing front door or a recessed entryway, some nice modern fixtures on either side can accentuate the welcoming nature of the entry. Larger fixtures are often better here.</li><li><strong>The garage:</strong>&nbsp;See below about garage doors and consider a translucent door with interior lighting or some wooden doors with accent lighting.</li></ul>



<h2>Split-level remodel: garage doors</h2>



<p>If your split-level features garage doors that face the street, they may represent your easiest and best option for modernization. Garage doors are often taken for granted. The original spec was probably a steel door with very little curb appeal. Most of the time, they are downright ugly.</p>



<p>But times have changed, and modern garage door designs can transform the look of the front of your home. Doors with glass-like, translucent flat panels are beautiful in daylight and at night, when interior light can turn them into giant night lights — all while obscuring the contents of your garage from neighbors.</p>



<p>Another great garage door style on a modern home is a wood-look door. If done properly, this can tie in wonderfully with the natural stone sections of wall mentioned above.</p>



<p>These are just a few ideas, and you can use them as a simple spark of design inspiration to get you going. Once you see the possibilities and start looking at the changes that can be made, you’ll realize that a split-level may have more potential to look great in decades to come than almost any other old-school design out there.</p>

<p>Everything you need to know about buying a home — on one index card.</p>



<p>A home is often the biggest financial investment you’ll make in your lifetime. In fact,&nbsp;a recent Zillow analysis&nbsp;reports that the typical American homeowner has 40% of their wealth tied up in their home.</p>



<p>Several years ago, I wrote&nbsp;a complete guide to financial planning&nbsp;on one index card, which&nbsp;went viral&nbsp;and later became a book: “The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn’t Have to Be Complicated” (co-written with Helaine Olen).</p>



<p>Now, following up on my original index card, I’ve written a guide on buying a house. Below is the housing index card — a handy resource to print and take with you as you look at houses or think about buying one — plus some additional advice as you contemplate making the big decision.</p>



<h2>1. Buy for the long run</h2>



<p>A home is a significant investment, not to mention a linchpin of stability. According to the&nbsp;Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trends Report 2017, the majority of Americans who sold their homes last year had lived in their home for at least a decade before selling.</p>



<p>Some are even staying for the long haul. Almost half (46%) of all homeowners are like me — living in the first home we ever purchased. In short: Buy a home you want to live in for at least five years — one equipped (or ready to be equipped) with the features and space you need, both now and in the future.</p>



<h2>2. Buy to improve your life, not speculate with money</h2>



<p>Your home is more than a financial investment; it’s where you sleep, eat, host friends, raise your children — it’s where your life happens.</p>



<p>The housing market is too unpredictable to buy a (primary) home purely because you think it will net a big short-term financial return. You will most likely be living in this home for several years, regardless of how it appreciates, so your first priority should be finding a home that will meet your needs and help you build the life you want.</p>



<h2>3. Focus on what’s important to you</h2>



<p>Today’s housing market is short on inventory, with&nbsp;10% fewer homes&nbsp;on the market in November 2017 than November 2016.</p>



<p>So, focus on finding a home you can afford that meets your needs — but don’t get distracted by shiny features that might break your budget. Nice-to-have features often drive up the price tag for things you don’t particularly value once the initial enjoyment wears off.</p>



<p>Make a list of your basic needs, both for your desired home and for your desired neighborhood. Stick to finding a home that meets these needs, without buying extra stuff that adds up.</p>



<h2>4. Set a budget and stick to it</h2>



<p>It’s important to set a budget early — ideally before you even start looking at homes. In today’s market, especially in the more competitive markets, it’s incredibly easy to go over budget —&nbsp;29%&nbsp;of buyers who purchased last year did.</p>



<p>The most common culprit? Location. Zillow’s data indicates that urban buyers are significantly more likely to go over budget (42%) than suburban (25%) or rural (20%) buyers.</p>



<p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with that. Local schools matter, and psychologists tell us that a short commute improves your life. But be realistic about your local market and about yourself. Know what you’re willing to compromise on — be it less square footage, home repairs or a different neighborhood.</p>



<h2>5. Aim for a 20% down payment</h2>



<p>If you can afford it, a 20% down payment is ideal for three reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Buyers who don’t put a full 20% down pay a premium, most commonly in the form of&nbsp;private mortgage insurance (PMI). This is less financially punishing than it used to be, given today’s low mortgage rates. A monthly mortgage payment (with PMI) may be lower than a monthly rental payment in many markets — but still.</li><li>Buyers who put more down upfront typically make fewer offers and buy faster than those who put less down.&nbsp;Zillow research&nbsp;found that buyers with higher down payments make 1.9 offers on average, compared to 2.4 offers for buyers with lower down payments (after controlling for market conditions).</li><li>A higher down payment reduces your financial risk. You don’t want to owe more money than your house is worth if local markets dip when you need to sell.</li></ul>



<h2>6. Keep a six-month strategic reserve</h2>



<p>While a down payment is a significant expense, it’s also important to build up a strategic reserve and keep it separate from your normal bank account.</p>



<p>This reserve should cover six months of living expenses in case you get sick, face an unexpected expense or lose your job. A strategic reserve will not only save you from financial hardship in an emergency but also provide peace of mind.</p>



<p>When we accumulated a strategic reserve, my wife and I finally felt ready to build for our future. Without it, we were living from paycheck to paycheck, anxiously managing our cash flow rather than saving or budgeting.</p>



<h2>7. Get pre-approved, and stick with a fixed-rate mortgage</h2>



<p>The pre-approval process requires organizing all your paperwork; documenting your income, debt and credit; and understanding all the loan options available to you. It’s a bit of a pain, but it saves time later.&nbsp;Getting pre-approved&nbsp;also shows sellers that you’re a reliable buyer with a strong financial footing. Most importantly, it helps you understand what you can afford.</p>



<p>There are a variety of&nbsp;mortgage types, and it’s important to evaluate all of them to see which is best for your family and financial situation. Those boring 30- and 15-year mortgages offer big advantages.</p>



<p>The biggest is locking in your mortgage rate. In short: A 30-year fixed mortgage has a specific fixed rate of interest that doesn’t change for 30 years. A 15-year fixed mortgage does the same.</p>



<p>These typically have lower rates but higher monthly payments, since you must pay it off in half the time. Conventional fixed-rate mortgages help you manage your household budgeting because you know precisely how much you’ll be paying every month for many years. They’re simple to understand, and current rates are low.</p>



<p>One final advantage is that they don’t tempt you with a low initial payment to buy more house than you can afford.</p>



<h2>8. Comparison shop to get the best mortgage</h2>



<p>Though a home is the biggest purchase many of us will ever make, most home buyers don’t&nbsp;shop around for a mortgage&nbsp;(52%&nbsp;consider only a single lender).</p>



<p>I certainly didn’t. This did save me some annoying calls and hassle, but it cost me $40 or $50 every month, for years. The difference of half a percentage point in your mortgage rate can add up to thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the loan. It’s important to evaluate all the available options to make sure you’re going with the lender who meets your needs — not just the first one you contact.</p>



<p>The three most important factors are that the lender offers a loan program that caters to their specific needs (76%), has the most competitive rates (74%) and has a history of closing on time (63%).</p>
