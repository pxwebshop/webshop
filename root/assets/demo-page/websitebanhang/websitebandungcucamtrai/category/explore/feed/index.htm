										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year on April 22nd, we take a moment out of our lives to celebrate the natural world and emphasize the importance of protecting our Earth. It is an opportunity to take action and demonstrate environmental awareness while also bringing to light the decisions we make on a daily basis which have an impact on the environment.<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0392/0497/files/1_cc32603b-71df-4c77-afa7-0796f9b997e9.jpg?v=1555956416" alt="" /></p>
<p>One rapidly growing decision which is proving to have a positive impact on our planet, is the movement away from consuming single use plastics. Each year, we produce millions of tons of plastic and only a small amount of them can actually be recycled. The rest will find their way into our oceans and natural spaces harming wildlife and affecting ecosystems. Reducing the use of these plastics in our daily lives and finding reusable solutions will prove to have a lasting impact on the health of our Earth.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0392/0497/files/2_5f3583c3-2e9c-4b7a-ada8-6fd53aaca913.jpg?v=1555958422" alt="" /></p>
<p>As a company that is deeply passionate about the natural world, we believe it is our responsibility to encourage change and positive decisions which better the environment. Our unique line of cutlery, drinking vessels, and tableware create a platform for Snow Peak to play a significant role in the movement away from single use plastics. We encourage and challenge individuals to reduce their environmental impact by making actively conscious decisions about their daily consumption habits.</p>
<p>In addition, we encourage you to look beyond your own individual consumption habits and seek out ways to affect groups that surround your daily life. If you are looking for ways to reduce the environmental impact at your office, Snow Peak is offering corporate solutions for you to make a large scale impact on the environment. Email orders@snowpeak.com for more information.</p>
<p>Our planet is too precious for us to simply sit back and hope for the best. A world in which we are not able to spend time outdoors to embrace our nature with friends and family is a space we don’t want to imagine. It’s time for us to take action and make the small changes in our daily life which will have a lasting impact on our environment for generations to come.</p>

<p>At Snow Peak, we&#8217;re true believers in the restorative nature of Takibi time. We feel that the most meaningful connections can be discovered through the simple act of gathering together around a good fire. In our latest Explore post, we show you just how easy it is to create your own Takibi scene, and restore a little humanity in the process with our iconic <a href="https://snowpeak.com/products/pack-carry-fireplace-starter-kit">Pack and Carry Fireplace set</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">What You’ll Need</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Newspaper</li>
<li class="li1">Kindling</li>
<li class="li1">Wood logs</li>
<li class="li1">Fire Tool Set</li>
<li class="li1"><a href="https://snowpeak.com/collections/fireplace-grills/products/pack-carry-fireplace-starter-kit">Pack and Carry Fireplace</a></li>
<li class="li1">Hatchet (optional)</li>
<li class="li1">Water</li>
<li class="li1">Lighter, matches, or Folding Torch (See Folding Torch Method at end)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Step 1: Crumple several sheets of recycled newspaper into a ball and set at the bottom of your fireplace.</p>
<p class="p1">Step 2: Gather up kindling. It will help ignite the fuel logs later in the process. </p>
<p class="p1">Step 3: Arrange your kindling three or four layers high in alternating sets of three directly on top of the newspaper.</p>
<p class="p1">Step 4: Carefully ignite the newspaper and add a few more layers of kindling to the fire. </p>
<p> Folding Torch Method</p>
<p>As an alternative method for starting your Takibi time, we recommend using the <a href="https://snowpeak.com/products/folding-torch">Snow Peak Folding Torch.</a> This powerful tool provides small concentrated flames which easily lights kindling at the bottom of your Pack &amp; Carry. Point the nozzle and burn wood evening until you hear it crackle at which point you know the fire will take off on it&#8217;s own. Slowly add larger logs in alternating directions to help fire grow. </p>
